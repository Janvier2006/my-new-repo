.Project Description

This project, titled “Rwanda’s Next Big Export Opportunity: Hass Avocado Production and Export Growth,”
identifies and analyzes the potential of Hass avocado as a major export product that can drive Rwanda’s economic growth.

The project aims to show how Rwanda can diversify its exports beyond traditional products such as coffee, tea, and
minerals by focusing on the high-demand global avocado market. It examines Rwanda’s export trends, challenges in the horticulture sector, and
strategies for increasing avocado production, processing, and export efficiency.
